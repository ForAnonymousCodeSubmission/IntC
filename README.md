## Invisibility Cloak: Disappearance under Human Pose Estimation via Backdoor Attacks

In `IntC.py`, we provide the implementations of our IntC attacks. As our attacks are based on existing HPE techniques, we only present the artifacts of our work.

When applying our IntC attacks to existing HPE techniques, please follow the below steps:

1. Config the environment following their instructions.
2. Involve our implementation codes `IntC.py`.
3. Call our function (in `IntC.py`) after loading the clean data for data poisoning.
